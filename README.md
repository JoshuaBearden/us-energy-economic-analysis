# U.S. Energy and Economic Analysis (1990–2024)

Final project for DSCI235 analyzing how environmental outcomes and consumer cost indicators changed across U.S. presidential administrations from 1990 through 2024.

## Project Overview

This project combines multiple public datasets to examine long-term trends in:

* U.S. CO2 emissions
* Energy Consumer Price Index (CPI)
* Transportation CPI
* Food at Home CPI
* Average U.S. gasoline prices
* Administration-era comparisons by president and political party

The objective is to explore how economic and environmental indicators changed over time while demonstrating data cleaning, merging, visualization, and descriptive statistical analysis using Python.

## Research Questions

* How have U.S. CO2 emissions changed since 1990?
* How have consumer energy and transportation costs changed over time?
* How have gasoline prices changed across administrations?
* What patterns appear when comparing presidential eras?
* Are there measurable correlations among emissions and price variables?

## Datasets Used

Publicly available sources including:

* Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
* U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
* U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook

## Methods

1. Imported raw CSV and Excel datasets
2. Cleaned inconsistent formats and column names
3. Converted monthly CPI series into annual averages
4. Merged datasets into a unified yearly panel (1990–2024)
5. Assigned presidential administration labels
6. Created summary statistics and visualizations
7. Performed correlation and comparative analysis

## Key Findings

* U.S. CO2 emissions generally declined in later years.
* Consumer price indicators increased substantially over time.
* Gasoline prices showed volatility tied to broader market conditions.
* Strong positive correlations existed among inflation-related variables.
* Administration comparisons are descriptive and should not be interpreted as causal.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy openpyxl
```

3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Run all cells in order.

## Limitations

* This project is descriptive rather than causal.
* Presidential administrations inherit trends from prior years.
* Global markets, recessions, wars, regulation, and technology shifts affect outcomes.
* Correlation does not imply causation.
